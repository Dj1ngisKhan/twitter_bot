## Description

Just a short program of how to build a free and very easy to code twitter bot - since it is free, you can only tweet quotes or pictures using it.
It uses gpt-3.5-turbo-1106, which is a bit outdated - but also free to run.

So we send questions (you can define your own questions for the gpt, but I have a list of questions I choose randomly from, before posting.)
Then we recieve an answer back, that gets sent and posted using twitters API.

## Required to set up before:

To run this code you will need to:

1. Get your twitter API keys on [twitter API](https://developer.x.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-1-0a/api-key-and-secret).

2.You would also need a API key from openai, which you can get by setting up an account on: [openai API_keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)

3. Then you will need to change these variables in the code, and have your tokens and keys instead:

```python

api_key = ""
api_secret=""
bearer_token = r""
access_token = ""
access_token_secret = ""

```

4. When that is done, you can either run the code to test it, or you make this a .exe file, and schedule it to run at surtain times and days (whenever you want).

NOTE: It is currently not active, because it was a fun project I built some time ago, and had it active for around 1month before I forgot it. /Poor bot...
